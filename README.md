-  **Loop-based Menu Navigation** – Allows users to go back and forth until they exit.



##  Why This Project is Awesome

- **Great for Beginners**: It's a fantastic way to learn C programming fundamentals including:
  - Structures (`struct`)
  - Arrays
  - Loops and conditions
  - Functions and modular coding
  - Simple data modeling (menu, cart, and order system)

- **Real-World Simulation**: Mimics the core logic behind food delivery apps like UberEats, Glovo, or DoorDash in a terminal interface.

- **Extendable**: You can easily enhance it by:
  - Adding file-based storage
  - Implementing user login/authentication
  - Using databases like MySQL for order history
  - Creating a GUI or web interface on top
